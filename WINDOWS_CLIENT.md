# Swordigo Windows x64 client

Native Windows client contribution; core/extras split prepared 25 October 2026. Read README.md and CREDITS.md for origin and license information. This is an experimental client, primarily tested with **Swordigo 1.4.13 ARM64 on Windows 11 x64**.

## Install from the Windows package

1. Extract the complete Windows client ZIP into a writable folder. Keep all DLLs, `platforms/`, `libs/`, `qt.conf` and notices together.
2. Supply a matching Swordigo game package. Original files are not included and are never downloaded by the importer.
3. For a manual 1.4.13 setup, copy `lib/arm64-v8a/libswordigo.so` into `engine/v1.4.13/arm64-v8a/libswordigo.so`, the complete APK `assets/` tree into `assets/` and game music from `res/raw/music_*` into `res/raw/`.
4. Run `Start-Swordigo.cmd`. Missing data produces a diagnostic instead of starting an incomplete game.

The full game asset tree is required, including `assets/resources/gamedata.gdata` (or `assets/gamedata.gdata`). Do not mix assets and libraries from different versions. If an extractor cannot represent both `X.scene` and the directory `X.scene/`, use `X.scenebin` for the file and `X.scene_res/` for the directory. The client supports these names.

Expected 1.4.13 ARM64 library SHA-256:

```

## Import your own APKM

The Windows ZIP includes a local importer. With Python 3.10+ installed, run from the extracted client folder:

```powershell
python tools/windows/import_apkm.py 'C:/path/to/Swordigo.apkm'
```

The importer checks the package identity, supported version and ARM64 library hash, then creates a separate `play-windows/Swordigo <version>/` folder. It preserves the clean client template, refuses to overwrite an existing installation and records original-file hashes in `game-files.json`. It supports the known 1.4.12 and 1.4.13 APKM layouts; 1.4.13 is the primary tested game.

From a source checkout, first build/package the client, then run the same command. Its `.tools/latest-package.txt` selects the built clean template. A plain APK can be installed manually as described above; this importer expects APKM split packages.

## Controls and branch scope

Default movement is A/D or arrow keys; jump is Space/W; attack and magic bindings are shown in the F2 editor. Existing personal bindings override defaults.

- **F1:** existing upstream client menu.
- **F2:** control editor; F2 saves/closes, R toggles key rebinding. Bindings persist after restarting.
- **F3:** existing upstream performance/debug display. The validated live XYZ reader is an extras feature.

Game Over accepts the original on-screen action and the supported keyboard inputs. Original game saves are separate from practice save/load-state features: **Save State and Load State are not implemented**.

This branch retains the existing upstream menus but does not add the 1.4.13 mod adapter, upgrade/item actions, physics tracing or performance simulation. Those additions are isolated on `codex/windows-extras`, which builds on this branch. Existing upstream practice controls do not establish speedrun eligibility.

## Saves and logs

Game data is loaded from the package folder. User profiles and controls use the existing `%APPDATA%/swordigo-desktop/` paths; game saves are under its `save/Documents/` tree. The starter writes `%LOCALAPPDATA%/SwordigoDesktop/logs/latest.log`. Personal saves, controls, traces and logs are not part of the release.

## Build from source

Requirements: Windows x64, Python 3.10+, Git, Windows `curl.exe` and 7-Zip. The tested toolchain is MinGW-w64 UCRT64 / GCC 16.2; dependencies are downloaded into `.tools/`, not installed globally. Original game data is unnecessary for building and the focused tests.

```powershell
python tools/windows/bootstrap.py
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/windows/build.ps1 -Python python
python tools/windows/verify_package.py
```

The build compiles the host, both ARM64 SREs and all six core client tests, runs CTest and produces `dist-windows/Swordigo-Windows-x64.zip`. `packages.lock.json` fixes package versions and SHA-256 hashes. If an old package is no longer available from the primary MSYS2 mirror, obtain that exact package from a trusted archive/cache; do not silently replace locked versions.

An existing compatible toolchain can be reused with `-ToolchainPrefix C:/path/to/ucrt64` on `build.ps1`. It changes only where build dependencies are read.

Upstream/editor instructions remain in BUILD.md and README.md; those targets have not been revalidated as part of this Windows client contribution.
